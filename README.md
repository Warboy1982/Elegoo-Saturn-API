## Saturn Sync
    
syncs a folder on your hard drive with storage on older model chitu boards

was developed for the original elegoo saturn, but probably works with the
mars line of printers as well.

.ctb files are automatically transferred without user interaction.

any additions, deletions or updates to .ctb files in the local folder will also happen on your printer's usb stick.

allows remote triggering of print jobs.


runs as a tray app, with an openable UI for checking sync status, sending print jobs, configuring the local folder, the printer IP, and the ping interval for establishing a connection.
